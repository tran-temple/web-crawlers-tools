## Xenu’s Link Sleuth - Find broken links on websites
**WHAT:** It is a free open source tool to check the broken link for a website. It was developed by Tilman Hausherr, and only for Windows. 
The link verification application looks for all URLs, images, backgrounds, frames, and maps present on a website, so users can sort them by their preferred criteria. 
It is capable of testing FTP, gopher, and SSL websites.
